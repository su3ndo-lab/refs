Figure <a name="fig:x">1</a> (a) Schematic of the experimental setup: granular packing is sheared by the motor on the linear stage, and the macroscopic shear force is measured by the force sensor. (b) Evolutions of the global volume fraction Ï• and shear force F within one cycle (ensemble averaged over 12 realizations).
