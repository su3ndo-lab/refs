I"<p>A uniform beam is diagonally positioned in such posture, so that left end of the beam is on a frictionless wall and the right end of the beam is on a floor with friction. The left end is at higher position in vertical direction compared to the right end. It is usually related to ladder [<a href="#ref1">1</a>].</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>A ladder, represented by an uniform beam, is positioned diagonally as shown in Fig. <a href="#dbar-floor-wall-0">1</a>, where the beam is in a stable condition. The wall is frictionless, while there is friction between right end of the beam and the floor.</p>

Figure <a name="dbar-floor-wall-0">1</a> A beam supported horizontally by two vertical wires.</p>

<p>Normal force from the wall to the beam is $N_{\rm wall}$ and form the floor $N_{\rm floor}$. There is also static friction between the beam and and the floor, named as $f_{\rm floor}$. Gravitational force $w$ is from point $O$ downward in the same direction with gravitational acceleration $\vec{g}$. Draw the free-body diagram of the beam and write all relations between $w$, $N_{\rm wall}$, $N_{\rm floor}$, and $f_{\rm floor}$ through length of the beam $L$ and angle of the beam with horizontal direction $\theta$.</p>
