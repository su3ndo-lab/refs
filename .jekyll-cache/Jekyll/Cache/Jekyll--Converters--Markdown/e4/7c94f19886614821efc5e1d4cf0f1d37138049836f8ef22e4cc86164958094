I"g<p>A uniform beam is hung horizontally from ceiling through two wires attached at some positions on the beam, where each wire has different angle with horizontal direction. It is a simpler case of a horizontal beam suspended by two cables, where a person standing on one of the end of the beam [<a href="#ref1">1</a>].</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>An uniform beam is supported horizontally by two wires attached to ceiling, where each wire has different angle with horizontal direction as shown in following Fig. <a href="#fig:shbar-vwire2-0">1</a>. The beam is in a stable condition.</p>

Figure <a name="fig:shbar-vwire2-0">1</a> A beam supported horizontally by two vertical wires.</p>

<p>Tension of left wire is marked as $T_1$, while tension of the other wire is marked as $T_2$. Length of the beam is $L$ and its mass is $m$. Point $O$ is position of center of the mass of the beam. Distance of point $B$ from point $O$ is $l_1$ and distance of point $D$ from point $O$ is $l_2$. If angle of the left wire with horizontal direction is $\theta_1$ and angle of the right wire with horizontal direction is $\theta_2$, find tension formulation of $T_1$ and $T_2$ as function of the other parameters.</p>
