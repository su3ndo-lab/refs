  <li>A force does positive work on a particle that has displacement pointing in the $+x$ direction.

  <li>Two iceboats hold a race on a frictionless horizontal lake. The two iceboats have masses $m$ and $2m$. The iceboats have identical sails, so the wind exerts the same constant force, $\vec{F}$ on each iceboat. They start from rest and cross the finish line a distance, $s$ away. Which iceboat crosses the finish line with greater kinetic energy? (a) $m$. (b) $2m$. (c) Both boats have the same kinetic energy. [∎] See [<a href="#ref2">2</a>] for the image.</li>

  <li>You apply a constant force $\vec{F} = (-68.0 \ {\rm N}) \hat{i} + (36.0 \ {\rm N}) \hat{j}$ to a $380-\rm kg$ car as the car travels $48.0 \ \rm m$ in a direction that is $240.0^\circ$ from the $+x$-axis. How much work does the force you apply do on the car?</li>
  <li>A $5.00-\rm kg$ package slides $1.50 \ \rm m$ down a long ramp that is inclined at $\alpha$ ($\tan \alpha = 3/4$) below the horizontal. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the package and the ramp is $\mu_k = 0.30$. Calculate (a) the work done on the package by friction; (b) the work done on the package by gravity; (c) the work done on the package by the normal force; (d) the total work done on the package; (e) If the package has a speed of $2.20 \ \rm m/s$ at the top of the ramp, what is its speed after sliding $1.50 \ \rm m$ down the ramp?</li>
  <li>A force $\vec{F}$ is applied to a $2.0-\rm kg$ radio-controlled model car parallel to the $x$-axis as it moves along a straight track. The $x$-component of the force varies with the $x$-coordinate of the car as shown in figure. Suppose the model car is initially at rest at $x = 0$. Use the work-energy theorem to find the speed of the car at (a) $ x = 3.0 \ \rm m$; (b) $x = 4.0 \ \rm m$; (c) $x = 7.0\ \rm m$. [∎] Graph of $F_x(\rm N)$ againts $x (\rm m)$ with points (0, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (6, -1), (6, 0), and (7, 0).</li>
  <li>The $200-\rm kg$ steel hammerhead of a pile driver is lifted $3.00 \ \rm m$ above the top of a vertical I-beam (point 1) being driven into the ground. The hammerhead is then dropped, driving the I-beam $7.4 \ \rm cm$ deeper into the ground (point 3). The vertical guide rails exert a constant $60-\rm N$ friction force on the hammerhead. Use the work–energy theorem to find (a) the speed of the hammerhead just as it hits the I-beam (point 2) and (b) the average force the hammerhead exerts on the I-beam. Ignore the effects of the air. [∎] See [<a href="#ref3">3</a>] for illustration.</li>
  <li>It is $5.0 \ \rm km$ from your home to the physics lab. As part of your physical fitness program, you could run that distance at $10 \ \rm km/h$ (which uses up energy at the rate of $700 \ \rm W$), or you could walk it leisurely at $3.0 \ \rm km/h$ (which uses energy at $290 \ \rm W$). Which choice would burn up more energy, and how much energy (in joules) would it burn?</li>
  <li>A $75-\rm kg$ roofer climbs a vertical $7.0-\rm m$ ladder to the flat roof of a house. He then walks $12 \ \rm m$ on the roof, climbs down another vertical $7.0-\rm m$ ladder, and finally walks on the ground back to his starting point. How much work is done on him by gravity (a) as he climbs up; (b) as he walks on the roof; (c) as he climbs down; (d) as he walks on the ground? (e) What is the total work done on him by gravity during this round trip? (f) On the basis of your answer to part (e), would you say that gravity is a conservative or nonconservative force? Explain.</li>
  <li>A $350-\rm kg$ roller coaster starts from rest at point A and slides down the frictionless loop-the-loop shown in figure (a) How fast is this roller coaster moving at point B? (b) What is the normal force on the roller coaster on the track surface at point B? [∎] See [<a href="#ref4">4</a>] for illustration of roller coaster track.</li>
  <li>A ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity $15.0 \ \rm m/s$ of at an angle of $60.0^\circ$ above the horizontal. Use energy conservation to find the ball’s greatest height above the ground. Ignore the effects of the air.</li>
  <li>A sled with rider having a combined mass of $125 \ \rm kg$ travels over the perfectly smooth icy hill shown in figure. How far does the sled land from the foot of the cliff? [∎] Intial velocity of the sled is $22.5 \ \rm m/s$ and height of the cliff is $11.0 \ \rm m$.</li>
  <li>A small $0.200-\rm kg$ package is released from rest at point A on a track that is one-quarter of a circle with radius $1.60 \ \rm m$. The size of the package is much less than $1.60 \ \rm m$, so the package can be treated as a particle. It slides down the track and reaches point B with a speed of $4.80 \ \rm m/s$. From point B, it slides on a level surface at distance of $3.00 \ \rm m$ to point C, where it comes to rest. (a) What is the coefficient of kinetic friction on the horizontal surface? (b) How much work is done on the package by friction as it slides down the circular arc from A to B? [∎] See [<a href="#ref5">5</a>] for illustration of package trajectory.</li>
