  <li>The velocity of a train is $80.0 \ \rm km/h$, due west. One and a half hours later its velocity is $65.0 \ \rm km/h$, due west. What is the train’s average acceleration? (a) $10.0 \ \rm km/h^2$, due west (b) $43.3 \ \rm km/h^2$, due west (c) $10.0 \ \rm km/h^2$, due east (d) $43.3 \ \rm km/h^2$, due east (e) $53.3 \ \rm km/h^2$, due east.</li>
  <li>The graph accompanying this problem shows a three-part motion. For each of the three parts, A, B, and C, identify the direction of the motion. A positive velocity denotes motion to the right. (a) A right, B left, C right. (b) A right, B right, C left. (c) A right, B left, C left. (d) A left, B right, C left. (e) A left, B right, C right. [∎] Graph of position againts time has point $o(0,0)$, $a(4,4)$, $b(6,2)$, and $c(9,3)$. Part A is $o-a$, part B is $a-b$, and part C is $b-c$.</li>
  <li>Ball 1 is thrown into the air and it follows the trajectory for projectile motion shown in the drawing. At the instant that ball 1 is at the top of its trajectory, ball 2 is dropped from rest from the same height. Which ball reaches the ground first? (a) Ball 1 reaches the ground first, since it is moving at the top of the trajectory, while ball 2 is dropped from rest. (b) Ball 2 reaches the ground first, because it has the shorter distance to travel. (c) Both balls reach the ground at the same time. (d) There is not enough information to tell which ball reaches the ground first. [∎] Drawing has two parts. The left figure is showing parabolic curve open downward with dashed line and at the top there is point with vector $v_x$ directed horizontally to the right and the name of Ball 1. In the dashed line there are vectors from bottom top and from top to bottom in the left and right parts of the parabolic curve, respectively. The right figure is showing a point at the same height as the point in the first figure and the name of Ball 2. There is a dashed line connected the point and the ground with arrow pointed downward in the line.</li>
  <li>The drawing shows two cars traveling in different directions with different speeds. Their velocities are: $\vec{v} _{AG}$ = velocity of car A relative to the Ground = $27.0 \ \rm m/s$, due east and $\vec{v} _{BG}$ = velocity of car B relative to the Ground = $21.0 \ \rm m/s$, due north.
The passenger of car B looks out the window and sees car A. What is the velocity (magnitude and direction) of car A as observed by the passenger of car B? In other words, what is the velocity $\vec{v} _{AB}$ of car A relative to car B? Give the directional angle of $\vec{v} _{AB}$ with respect to due east. [∎] Drawing is showin two cars. Car A is moving to the right (east) with $\vec{v} _{AG}$ in front of it and there is a dashed line connecting the car and the word east. Car B is moving to the top (north) with $\vec{v} _{BG}$ in front of it and there is a dashed line connecting the car and the word north.</li>

  <li>A car makes a trip due north for three-fourths of the time and due south one-fourth of the time. The average northward velocity has a magnitude of $27 \ \rm m/s$, and the average southward velocity has a magnitude of $17 \ \rm m/s$. What is the average velocity (magnitude and direction) for the entire trip?</li>
  <li>Two motorcycles are traveling due east with different velocities. However, four seconds later, they have the same velocity. During this four-second interval, motorcycle A has an average acceleration of $2.0 \ \rm m/s^22$ due east, while motorcycle B has an average acceleration of $4.0 \ \rm m/s^2$ due east. By how much did the speeds differ at the beginning of the four-second interval, and which motorcycle was moving faster?</li>
  <li>An astronaut on a distant planet wants to determine its acceleration due to gravity. The astronaut throws a rock straight up with a velocity of $15 \ \rm m/s$ and measures a time of $20.0 \ \rm s$ before the rock returns to his hand. What is the acceleration (magnitude and direction) due to gravity on this planet?</li>
  <li>While standing on a bridge $15.0 \ \rm m$ above the ground, you drop a stone from rest. When the stone has fallen $3.20 \ \rm m$, you throw a second stone straight down. What initial velocity must you give the second stone if they are both to reach the ground at the same instant? Take the downward direction to be the negative direction.</li>
  <li>A bus makes a trip according to the position–time graph shown in the drawing. What is the average velocity (magnitude and direction) of the bus during each of the segments A, B, and C? Express your answers in $\rm km/h$. [∎] In the position-time graph position $x$ is in $km$ and time $t$ is in $h$. There are also $i(0, 40.0)$, $j(1.5, 10.0)$, $k(2.5, 20.0)$, and $l(3.0, 40.0)$ points, where segment A is $i-j$, B is $j-k$, and C is $k-l$.</li>
  <li>A woman and her dog are out for a morning run to the river, which is located $4.0 \ \rm km$ away. The woman runs at $2.5 \ \rm m/s$ in a straight line. The dog is unleashed and runs back and forth at $4.5 \ \rm m/s$ between his owner and the river, until the woman reaches the river. What is the total distance run by the dog?</li>
  <li>The earth moves around the sun in a nearly circular orbit of radius $1.50 \times 10^{11} \ \rm m$. During the three summer months (an elapsed time of $7.89 \times 10^6 \ \rm s$), the earth moves one-fourth of the distance around the sun. (a) What is the average speed of the earth? (b) What is the magnitude of the average velocity of the earth during this period?</li>
  <li>On a spacecraft, two engines are turned on for $684 \ \rm s$ at a moment when the velocity of the craft has $x$ and $y$ components of $v_{0x} = 4370 \ \rm m/s$ and $v_{0y} = 6280 \ \rm m/s$. While the engines are firing, the craft undergoes a displacement that has components of $x = 4.11 \times 10^6 \ \rm m$ and $y = 6.07 \times 10^6 \ \rm m$. Find the $x$ and $y$ components of the craft’s acceleration.</li>
  <li>From the top of a tall building, a gun is fired. The bullet leaves the gun at a speed of $340 \ \rm m/s$, parallel to the ground. As the drawing shows, the bullet puts a hole in a window of another building and hits the wall that faces the window. Using the data in the drawing, determine the distances $D$ and $H$, which locate the point where the gun was fired. Assume that the bullet does not slow down as it passes through the window. [∎] There are two building, where the left is taller than the right. Horizontal distance between building is $D$. Vertical distance between gun and bullet in wall is $H$. Horizontal distance between hole in window and bullet in wall is $6.9 \ \rm m$, while their vertical distance is $0.50 \ \rm m$.</li>
  <li>Mario, a hockey player, is skating due south at a
speed of $7.0 \ \rm m/s$ relative to the ice. A teammate passes the puck to him. The puck has a speed of $11.0 \ \rm m/s$ and is moving in a direction of $22°$ west of south, relative to the ice. What are the magnitude and direction (relative to due south) of the puck’s velocity, as observed by Mario?</li>
